# Design-implementaion-of-a-1-Bit-Full-Adder-using-28-nm-CMOS-technology
This repository presents the design and implementation of a 1-Bit Full Adder circuit using 28 CMOS technology. All the Simulations are done on Synopsis tool. For the representation of inputs and outputs, we have taken voltage range 0v to 1.8v. The truth table of the 1- Bit Full Adder is verified by the waveform obtained from the simulation. Full adder can be designed using two Half adders but this design is a little modified version with less no of MOSFETs.
