# Design-implementaion-of-a-1-Bit-Full-Adder-using-28-nm-CMOS-technology
This repository presents the design and implementation of a 1-Bit Full Adder circuit using 28 CMOS technology. All the Simulations are done on Synopsis tool. For the representation of inputs and outputs, we have taken voltage range 0v to 1.8v. The truth table of the 1- Bit Full Adder is verified by the waveform obtained from the simulation. Full adder can be designed using two Half adders but this design is a little modified version with less no of MOSFETs.

# Introduction
Addition is one of the fundamental arithmetic operations. Adder is the core element of complex arithmetic circuits like addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, exponentiation address calculation and generation in case of cache memory etc. Adders are classified as Half Adder and Full Adder. The Half adder takes two inputs A and B and generates two outputs such as Sum and Carry, no previous carry is taken in account. But in case of a Full Adder, it takes three inputs like A, B and Cin (previous carry), and generated two outputs such as Sum and Carry.
